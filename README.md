Smart Dustbin Project
This project serves as a testing ground for my IoT system expertise. The Smart Dustbin is designed with the purpose of automating waste disposal. When a user approaches the dustbin, it automatically opens for use. Additionally, the system sends a notification to the user via email when the dustbin reaches 80 percent capacity.
Key Components:

Servo Motor: Enables the automatic opening and closing of the dustbin lid, providing a hands-free user experience.
Node MCU: Serves as the microcontroller, orchestrating the communication and coordination among the project's various components.
IR Sensor: Detects motion in the proximity of the dustbin, triggering the automatic opening mechanism when a user approaches.
Ultrasonic Sensor: Measures the level of waste in the dustbin, allowing the system to send timely email notifications when the capacity reaches 80 percent.

Key Features:
Automatic Opening: The dustbin opens seamlessly as the user approaches, providing a convenient and touch-free experience.
Capacity Notification: Users receive email notifications when the dustbin reaches 80 percent capacity, ensuring timely emptying.
Blynk IoT Integration: Leveraging the Blynk IoT app, users can stay updated on the dustbin's level and overall device maintenance.

This project not only showcases my IoT skills but also emphasizes user integration for a seamless and informed experience.
